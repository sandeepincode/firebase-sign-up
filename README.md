# Firebase Sign Up
A straight forward way to push users emails and other details to a firebase database. You can use it for sites where you want 
to register user interest for a product or anything else! Feel free to do whatever you like to the code.

# How To Run
1. npm i
2. Create a "privateKey.json" file which stores your firebase private key
3. Add the URL for the data to config.json, remember to check the path of the private key as well.
4. npm start 
5. Have fun :)
